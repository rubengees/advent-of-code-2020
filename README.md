# advent-of-code-2023

These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2020.

I didn't attempt them at that year but instead doing them for fun mow.

Similar to 2023, I solved them using Typescript and Bun with no special constraints otherwise. 

For each day there is a folder in `src` with the solution, tests and the input.

Tests can be run using `bun test`, all days with `bun start` and a specific day with `bun start <day>`.
